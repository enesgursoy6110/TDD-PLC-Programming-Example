Hello,

You may have heard of the Test Driven Development approach before.

The TDD approach is very important in industrial software.
We need to debug the algorithms we write on a micro scale and
It is very important to test all possibilities that they will be exposed to in a live working environment.
This not only increases our confidence in the code we write, but also prevents us from encountering surprises during commissioning.
Even if the code development phase is extended, it is better to spend this time in the office than under stress during commissioning.
In the example project, I made a sample application using the ETEST framework of the EcoStruxure Machine Expert program.
With this framework, you can put the function classes you write into the test series using "Test Set" and catch errors.
